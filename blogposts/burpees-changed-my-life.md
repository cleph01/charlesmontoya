## Strong body, strong mind. 💡

When the pandemic started, and folks celebrated the opportunity to couch surf, something inside me told me to go a level deeper and use this time, and at times solitude, differently.

## Discovering the Power of the Burpee 🏋️‍♂️

I began going down different rabbit holes. If I think hard enough, I believe it started with a YouTube video, a poem from Facundo Cabral, “No estas deprimido. Estas distraido” (You’re not depressed. You’re distracted [from the truth]) that started it all.

## Journey into Mental Toughness 🧠

Then his audio book which starts with the lines “Get up and go. Get up from that bed where you lie with the multitude…” that began my journey reading and listening to Carl Jung, Jordan Peterson, Joseph Campbell, David Goggins, Jacko Willink, and the Iron Wolf. Pretty much in that order.

## The Psychological Plunge of the Burpee 💥

It was the Iron Wolf who ultimately gave me an important tool I needed, a tool - I argue - everyone can benefit from, the Burpee.

The Burpee is not just a physical experience. It is a psychological plunge into the depths of one's soul.

Rep by rep the voice inside our head telling us to “quit, the is stupid anyway, go do something else, this is too hard, no one is watching” gets louder and louder.

## Embracing the Challenge 🏃‍♂️

The mental battle is very real.

The burpee is a furnace for the body and for the mind.

Do it. Experience it for yourself.

Start by doing 100 burpees in a session. Skip the jump part. Take as much time as you need between reps. Skip-step in place while the lactic acid in your chest and arms calms down. Keep good form. Limit the rest < 30 seconds. And Don't rush.

Embrace the pain.

## Transformation through Persistence 🌟

It will likely take you 45 min to an hour to complete this therapy session - and you will be absolutely gassed.

But when you’ve done them... and then do that routine again the next day, and the next day, and the day after that… for 30 days straight (the first of many Iron Wolf challenges) you will emerge on the other side physically stronger and mentally tougher than any other time in your life.

## Conclusion: A Lifelong Companion in Challenge 🚀

I do 300-500 per session now.

Burpees changed my life and continues to keep me mentally and physically prepared to face life's relentless challenges.
