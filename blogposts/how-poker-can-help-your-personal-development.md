## What does Yawning have to do with Poker? 🃏

They both share this concept of a “tell” 🤫.

## Discovering a Psychological "Tell" at the Scientology Center 🕵️‍♂️

Don't judge me, but I was introduced to this one particular psychological "tell" while hanging out in the Scientology reading room at their Harlem center.

And no... I didn't "join” - it was too expensive 😆.

But, this personal development hack has been quite profound.

## Understanding the Concept of a "Tell" 🧠

So, what’s a tell? In poker, a "tell" is a subconscious action or behavior that reveals information about a player's hand strength or intentions, often betraying their emotions or strategy. These cues can include changes in body language, speech patterns, or betting habits. [Thank you chatGPT]

## The Secret Only Devout Scientologists Know 🤔 lol

Ok, so. what is this secret that only people like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, devout Scientologists, know about?

The yawn. 😮

Turns out if you pay attention you'll discover that when our minds encounter something challenging, something that pushes us passed our comfort zone... We yawn.

## Exploring the Deeper Significance of Yawning 😴

You might be saying… “Uh, yea, duh. I already know this. When I’m in a quite room and trying to read and getting sleepy, I yawn. This is not Breaking News”.

True, but, pay close attention to when you’re not sleepy.

Notice when you’re well-rested and working on something challenging (whether mentally or physically) - and you yawn.

## The Role of Yawning in Personal Development 📚

So, in the library at the Scientology center there are people there to help as tutors - and one of the things they watch out for are yawns.

When they see someone yawn they come over and help you become aware of the fact that you’re yawning and encourage you to dig into the concept you were just reading. What about it is challenging you?

## Embracing Yawning as a Sign of Struggle 💪

What I found curious was their point that the yawn reveals something deeper than just sleepiness or lack of oxygen.

After leaving, I began to notice that I would yawn when I'm NOT tired or in a sleep-inducing environment.

To my befuddlement, I would yawn when fully rested and awake.

## Yawning in the Boxing Ring 😲

Stranger still, I would even begin yawning before hopping in the boxing ring to spar!

Over all, it calls on a deep self-honesty and curiousity to be introspective, to step away from being the one yawning to being the one analyzing what is going on internally that’s inducing the yawn.

## Rethinking Yawning: A Sign of Internal Struggle 🤯

Because, come on... to start yawning right before jumping in to spar...?

That's one h3ll of a time for the body to tap me on the shoulder to tell me I'm tired.

What’s worse, if it is a psychological tell, then what the h#ll is my body doing signaling to my opponent that "I'm sleepy” - when I anything but "sleepy".

So what "was" I? I was uncomfortable. I was subconsciously reconciling the battle-training I was about to engage in.

Clearly, boxing is an unnatural thing to do and would surely make anyone (and their brain) uncomfortable.

## Insights From a Prime Mike Tyson 💪

I found my yawning before sparring odd and wondered if it only happened to me.

Surely, it was something wrong with me, some deep seeded cowardice I'm working through... until I saw a video of prime Mike Tyson, lacing up his gloves minutes before some scheduled sparring… and he started yawning! 😲

And it wasn’t just one yawn, it was one yawn after another. Maybe like 3 or 4.

The same sequence that would happen to me.

Here was Iron Mike, Kid Dynamite, the reigning heavy weight champ showing his proverbial cards.

For those who connected the dots, it told us he was uncomfortable.

However, as it was later demonstrated when he'd dismantle his opponents, he was still very capable of rising above whatever was revealing itself and kick tail.

But it showed that deep human connection and similarity we all share.

## Conclusion: Yawning as a Symbol of Courage in the Making💡

So, nowadays, I don't dismiss yawning as just being a sign of sleepiness.

It's more like a sign of struggle (even in a small sense) against something.

Sometimes it pops up during a rigorous Burpee routine and/or during some challenging studies.

This hack has become extremely insightful.

It gives me the awareness to step back and assess what’s going on before getting in my Mike Tyson mode and doing the work necessary to kick a$$ despite whatever internal discomfort is going on.

The yawn, has become for me, a placeholder for “insert courage here”.

And it’s made a huge difference in my life.
