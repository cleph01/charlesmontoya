**Why I Stopped Chasing Web Dev: A Journey of Self-Discovery**

![AI Taking Over](/assets/images/blog/careerPivot.jpg)

In my journey of trying to find my place in this vast realm of technology, I've explored various domains.

I've dipped my toes into data and business analytics, SEO, and software development. 🌐

Yet, here I stand today, pondering something that's been staring at me all along but I've not notice until now — a crucial aspect of technology, infrastructure. 👷‍♂️

**Reflecting on the Journey:**
So, the elephant in the room: is this post merely a verbose way of saying "I quit"?

Or is it an honest, rational re-assessment of my trajectory — a course correction, like a rocket adjusting to its target? 🚀

This introspection, full of a lifetime of should'a, could'a, would'a(s), is a deeply personal one, yet it's also clearly essential for pointing out the obstacles in my way and re-calibrating my approach. 🎯

**Discovering Inner Strengths:**
Credit goes to online personalities like David Goggins, Jocko Willink, Jordan Peterson, and the Iron Wolf for introducing me to a number of psychological tools that have helped me undertake this inner-work with a warrior mindset. 💪

So starting amidst the pandemic, I started consciously building what Goggins calls a "cookie jar," a mental reservoir of hard-won and self-imposed adversities. From cold showers to high-rep burpees to getting in the boxing ring, each challenge unearthed a level of resilience and perseverance within me that had been previously untapped. 🤺

I began documenting this journey on IG and over a three-year period, I became "Charlie Burpee" and obtained 500+ followers. 💨

This new found work ethic and resilient character helped me confront the trouble I was having with data structures and algorithms. 👨🏻‍💻

I sold my motorcycle, quit my plumbing job and began studying for 10-12 hours a day for four months straight. I made incredible progress. But it wasn't enough, unfortunately. 🥴

Failed interviews at Capital One, Bloomberg (twice) and Facebook spawned more doubts. 👀

**Navigating Challenges and Seeking Guidance:**
Facing these uncertainties head-on, I immersed myself in 2 intensive data structure and algorithm bootcamps.

I was taking action, but my head was a mess. A full-blown existential crisis was raging inside of me.

So I sought counsel from a therapist, which helped and prompted reflection on what I was really holding on to. Was it ego or conviction leading the way? 🤔

**Reaffirming Commitment Through Academic Pursuits:**
Nevertheless, I dug in further. I know my lack of a computer science degree doesn't help me and I know I have knowledge gaps, so I enrolled in an online CS bachelor's program.

I studied harder during my college algebra course than I ever had in my life. 📚

I thought I was going to bomb the class, but I ended up passing with an 86. 🎉

With unwavering dedication, I'd surpassed my expectations, realizing my capabilities and bolstering confidence. 🎓

Another tremendous cookie added to my cookie jar. 🍪

**Embracing Clarity and Adaptability:**
This journey has underscored the importance of recognizing my strengths and weaknesses.

Jumping into adversity headfirst has helped built more self-trust and resilience. 🌱

**From Plumbing to Networking and Cybersecurity:**
My eclectic background, which includes construction and plumbing, offers a unique perspective on infrastructure.

The allure of working behind the scenes reignited my passion.

Networking, like plumbing, embodies practical skills vital for a digital society, while cybersecurity's perpetual demand and emphasis on web integrity will always be a bulwark against people trying to break it. 🔧

**Current Pursuits and Future Aspirations:**
So where am I today, well, presently I'm diligently studying for certifications in CCNA and Google Cybersecurity Professional, laying the groundwork for a promising career. 💼

These endeavors will symbolize my commitment to showcasing a passion for learning and readiness in this dynamic field.

**Conclusion:**
My transition is the product of practicality, personal growth, and foresight.

What stands between me and a career in software development demands more time, while networking and cybersecurity, which also requires time, seems to offer clearer paths for growth and career with the help of certifications and hands-on labs.

It's a more hands-on path, they leveraging my strengths, and it anticipates industry trends.

So, I honestly do feel like I'm positioning myself in a much better for a fulfilling career in today's tech landscape. 🌟
