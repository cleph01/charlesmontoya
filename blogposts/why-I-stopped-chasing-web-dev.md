**Why I Stopped Chasing Web Dev: A Journey of Self-Discovery**

![AI Taking Over](/assets/images/blog/careerPivot.jpg)

**Introduction:**
In my journey through the vast realm of technology, I've explored various domains, dipping my toes into data analytics, machine learning, and software development. 🌐

Yet, here I stand today, pondering something that's been in front of me all along but I've neglected until now—a crucial aspect of technology, infrastructure. 👷‍♂️

**Reflecting on the Journey:**
Let's address the elephant in the room: is this post merely a verbose way of saying "I quit"? Or is it a rational reassessment of my trajectory—a course correction akin to a rocket finding its target? 🚀

This introspection, laden with a lifetime of shoulda, coulda, wouldas, is deeply personal yet essential for acknowledging obstacles and recalibrating my approach. 🎯

**Discovering Inner Strengths:**
Credit goes to online personalities like David Goggins, Jocko Willing, Jordan Peterson, and the Iron Wolf for introducing me to psychological tools for constructive inner-work with a warrior mindset. 💪

Amidst the pandemic, I built what Goggins calls a "cookie jar," a mental reservoir documenting self-imposed adversities. From cold showers to high-rep burpees, each challenge unearthed resilience and perseverance within me. 🤺

One rep at a time I became "Charlie Burpee". 💨

This new found character and work ethic helped me get back into the fight with data structures and algorithms. 👨🏻‍💻

I sold my motorcycle, quit my plumbing job and began studying for 10-12 hours a day for four months straight. I made incredible progress. But not enough unfortunately. 🥴

Failed interviews at Capital One, Bloomberg (twice) and Facebook introduced me to more doubts. 👀

**Navigating Challenges and Seeking Guidance:**
Facing doubts head-on, I immersed myself in intensive data structure and algorithm bootcamps, confronting a full-blown existential crisis.

Seeking counsel from a therapist proved enlightening, prompting reflection on the balance between ego and conviction. 🤔

**Reaffirming Commitment Through Academic Pursuits:**
To bridge perceived knowledge gaps, I enrolled in an online computer science bachelor's program, facing rigorous challenges like college algebra.

I studied harder than I ever had in my life. 📚

I thought I was going to bomb the class, but I ended up passing with an 86. 🎉

With unwavering dedication, I'd surpassed my expectations, realizing my capabilities and bolstering confidence. 🎓

Another tremendous cookie added to my cookie jar. 🍪

**Embracing Clarity and Adaptability:**
This journey has underscored the importance of recognizing my strengths and weaknesses. Jumping into adversity headfirst has helped built more self-trust and resilience. 🌱

**From Plumbing to Networking and Cybersecurity:**
My eclectic background, including plumbing, offers a unique perspective on infrastructure. The allure of working behind the scenes reignited my passion. Networking, akin to plumbing, embodies practical skills vital for digital society, while cybersecurity's perpetual demand and emphasis on web integrity captivate me. 🔧

**Current Pursuits and Future Aspirations:**
So where am I today, well, presently I'm diligently studying for certifications in CCNA and Google Cybersecurity Professional, laying the groundwork for a promising career. These endeavors will symbolize my commitment to showcasing a passion for learning and readiness in this dynamic field. 💼

**Conclusion:**
My transition signifies a blend of practicality, personal growth, and foresight.

What stands between me and a software development career demandeds more time, while networking and cybersecurity offer clearer paths for growth.

By embracing a more hands-on path, leveraging my strengths, and anticipating industry trends, I'm positioning myself for a fulfilling career in today's tech landscape. 🌟
